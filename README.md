# GaussianFlow: Splatting Gaussian Dynamics for 4D Content Creation

Please refer to [this repo](https://github.com/Zerg-Overmind/diff-gaussian-rasterization) for our cuda implementations of variables for calculating Gaussian flow.

For now, we refer to our pseudo code to calculate Gaussian flow with variables from above.
